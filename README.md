# Clustering and Analysis of Cancer Risk Data set

### Project 3 of Algorithmic Thinking (Part 2)

This project aims to implement and analyze two methods of clustering: k-means clustering and 
hierarchical clustering on a cancer risk by air toxicity dataset (more about the dataset [here](https://www.epa.gov/national-air-toxics-assessment/2005-national-air-toxics-assessment)).

This project has been built as a part of a Coursera course: [Algorithmic Thinking (Part 2)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-thinking-2)

Some of the code was provided as a template.

The Jupyter notebooks can be used to generate the graphs there in the `graphs` directory.
